## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
Detailed 5-Point Idea for Web-Based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software

Virtual Interview Experience:

Provides a seamless and interactive video conferencing platform.

Includes real-time chat features for clarifying doubts.

Offers a customizable interface for different types of interviews (technical, HR, managerial).

Supports multi-panel interviews with multiple interviewers.

AI-Based Question Validation:

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to classify questions based on the candidate's expertise.

Filters out irrelevant or biased questions automatically.

Provides suggestions to interviewers for improving question quality.

Ensures consistency in question patterns across all interviews.

Answer Assessment System:

Uses AI models like BERT to evaluate responses for technical accuracy, fluency, and depth.

Grades answers on multiple parameters such as relevance, conciseness, and domain knowledge.

Provides instant feedback to interviewers on answer quality.

Allows for manual override by interviewers if necessary.

Real-Time Scoring Mechanism:

Calculates scores dynamically based on question relevance and answer quality.

Maintains a transparent scoring system visible to both interviewers and candidates.

Provides weightage to different sections like technical, managerial, and soft skills.

Stores scores in a secure database for future reference.

Automated Report Generation:

Compiles interview transcripts with question-answer pairs.

Generates performance analytics with detailed charts.

Provides overall suitability scores for easy decision-making.

Sends personalized feedback reports to candidates and interviewers.

This comprehensive system ensures transparent, unbiased, and efficient recruitment processes for any organization.
